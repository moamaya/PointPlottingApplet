Title: Plotting App

Name: Marlo Amaya

Description:

Steps 1-4 Creating the Canvas and plotting/editing points

This one file contains all the classes within it (pointPlot.java) It should run fine this way.
It works great throughout the first few steps! Plotting the points, drawing the lines between two points and moving points around works fine. 

When Design is selected you’ll be able to plot points on the canvas, and the points will be added to the table.
Switching to edit allows you to move the points, and also select points on the table to then add a line between them.

Steps 5 Import/exporting files

I haven’t completed the importing from file method since I got stuck on the editing part, but exporting should work. I just did not create a way to allow the user to chose where to export to.

Other Stuff

I tried creating a way to undo a line, but I had trouble using “repaint()” after deleting the last line drawn from my ArrayList<Shape> so I haven’t completed it, but thought it’d be useful to have.

If you try to drag the buttons after drawing some lines it will continue to draw lines along the path of the cursor. I haven’t gotten a chance to fix that yet. (Looks kind of cool anyway!)

Thanks

Thanks for taking the time to read this, and expect updates to this project!
